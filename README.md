Although I still don't know much about System Integration and Architecture,  I anticipate that this subject will help me comprehend how various components of 
a computer system interact. My understanding of the term "integration" is that it refers to joining systems to enable communication and unity.

Additionally, I believe that the "architecture" part will describe a system's design or structure. Perhaps it has to do with the arrangement of the parts and 
how they work together to support the system.

Lastly, I expect this subject to give me new knowledge that I can use in my future studies. Even if it seems difficult at first, I am willing to learn step by 
step. By the end, I want to have a better understanding of both integration and architecture in the world of Information Technology.
